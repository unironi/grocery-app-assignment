Tech Stack:
- Angular, HTML, CSS, AWS S3 bucket for frontend
- Django/Python, AWS EC2 for backend API and data persistence

Docker was causing issues on my computer so I wasn't able to successfully test if all the components were working inside the container. Alternatively, `cd ./grocerylist/` and run `python manage.py runserver` and in a separate terminal `cd ./grocerylist-frontend/` and run `ng serve` to run locally.
